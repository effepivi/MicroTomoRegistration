 ABSTRACT = {Registration has been studied extensively for the past few decades. In this paper we propose a novel idea to solve the registration of 3D triangular models onto 2D projections.
Our approach relies extensively on global optimisation methods and fast X-ray simulation on GPU. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on two registration problems:
i) 3D kinematic configuration of a 3D hand model, i.e. the recovery of the original hand pose from a postero-anterior (PA) view radiograph. The performance is measured by Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
ii) Automatic estimation of the position and rigid transformation of geometric shapes (cube and cylinders) to match an actual metallic sample made of Ti/SiC fibre composite with tungsten (W) cores. In this case the performance is measured in term of F-score (86\%), accuracy (95\%), precision (75\%), sensitivity (100\%), and true negative rate (94\%).

To evaluate our pipeline, each optimisation is repeated 15 times to gather statistically meaningful results, in particular to assess the reproducibility of the outputs.
Our registration framework is successful for both test-cases when using a suitable optimisation algorithm.},

  abstract = "We present a framework that combines evolutionary 
    optimisation, soft tissue modelling and ray tracing on GPU to 
    simultaneously compute the respiratory motion and X-ray imaging in 
    real-time. Our aim is to provide validated building blocks with high 
    fidelity to closely match both the human physiology and the physics of 
    X-rays. A CPU-based set of algorithms is presented to model organ 
    behaviours during respiration. Soft tissue deformation is computed with an
    extension of the Chain Mail method. Rigid elements move according to 
    kinematic laws. A GPU-based surface rendering method is proposed to 
    compute the X-ray image using the Beer–Lambert law. It is provided as an 
    open-source library. A quantitative validation study is provided to 
    objectively assess the accuracy of both components: (i) the respiration 
    against anatomical data, and (ii) the X-ray against the Beer–Lambert law and 
    the results of Monte Carlo simulations. Our implementation can be used in 
    various applications, such as interactive medical virtual environment to 
    train percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography in interventional radiology,
     2D/3D registration, computation of digitally reconstructed radiograph, 
     simulation of 4D sinograms to test tomography reconstruction tools.",
