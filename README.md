# MicroTomoRegistration
Registration of 3D triangular meshes onto a 2D image can be performed using optimisation and fast X-ray simulation on GPU. Automatic estimation of the position and rigid transformation of geometric shapes (cube and cylinders) to match an actual metallic sample made of Ti/SiC fibre composite with tungsten (W) cores.
